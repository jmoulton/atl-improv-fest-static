  In this workshop we will explore informational group game work.
  We will explore group game theory and play non-scenic, informational
  games that can be used as openings and in the ‘game slots’ of a Harold
  or any long form. Uhlir's approach to teaching group games is a favorite
  of students and teams at iO Chicago.
