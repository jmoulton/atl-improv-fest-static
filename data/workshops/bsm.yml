  BeerSharkMice members are offering a Master Improv class to
  all Atlanta students past and present at the Village Theater.
  The class will be a three-hour workshop intensive with four
  members of BeerSharkMice. 
  BeerSharkMice, previous winners of “Improv group of the
  year,” is a long-form improvisational show that originated at
  the
  iO West in Los Angeles. It’s generally a one hour performance
  based on an audience suggestion of a location. The location is
  the jumping off point for an array of scenes where the players
  tag in and out spinning the scene or scenes in different
  directions or wildly out of control, often ending up back at
  the original starting point.
  The workshop will be conducted by: Peter Hulne, Michael
  Coleman, Paul Vaillancourt and Pat Finn. Collectively they
  have been improvising and teaching for over 30 years. They
  have taught on the corporate level as well as festivals, at the
  iO, and at Universities such as: UCLA, CU Boulder, Indiana,
  LMU, Pepperdine, and Marquette. Their vast resumes include:
  Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Middle, Brooklyn 99, Drunk
  History, The Blame Game, 2 Broke Girls, Seinfeld, Speechless,
  Factory, Modern Family, Marvel Agent of S.H.E.I.L.D.,
  Goldbergs, GLOW and many more. This is an opportunity to
  learn from some of the best, to hear stories and gain tools to
  help you in every facet of your improv game. In this workshop
  you will learn to make stronger choices, listen better, build
  more team trust, and have the ability to play and have more
  fun on stage.

  # Breakdown.

  <br/>
  We will begin with an opening lecture
  and Q and A. We’ll cover the basics of improv and how our
  form came about. We will highlight how to get the most out
  of your time on stage. Students will learn games and get
  actual stage time throughout. Depending on the class size, we
  will break into smaller groups and rotate so that everyone can
  build on the strengths and individual styles of each teacher.
  We will then regroup and concentrate on scene work. Each
  teacher will focus on the following: 

  **Peter Hulne**: Object and space work, physicality, character
  and location understanding.

  **Michael Coleman**: Relationships, trust, strong scene choices,
  and the little things. 

  **Paul Vaillancourt**: Opening scenes, starting in the middle,
  reading your partner, group scenes.

  **Pat Finn**: Better edits, heightening scenes, callbacks and gifts,
  going wide on tag outs.

  <br/>
  Don’t miss a chance to be a better improvisor, a stronger all-
  around player, and a reliable teammate.
