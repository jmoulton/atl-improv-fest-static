title: "SHRILL*"
teacher: "Anděl Sudik"
time: "Saturday 3:15pm"
description: |
  A workshop for female-identifying improvisers of all shapes/sizes/levels.
  Bitch, your body is beautiful but that’s besides the point. The point is we all have one
  so let’s move it like noone’s watching.

  Rooted in physical theater we will move, play and get out of our heads and into our
  bodies. Great if you love to move, better if you don’t. Come give voice to that thing
  you live inside all the time. This workshop is highly experiential: dress comfortably
  and bring water. There will be sweat.

  _*Shrill by Lindy West. And shrill like the word used when people don’t like what we
  say so they call out our tone._
