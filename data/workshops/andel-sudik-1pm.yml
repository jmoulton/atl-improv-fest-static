description: That thing you hate about yourself? It's your greatest gift. We’ve all got baggage and while improv isn’t therapy it can be very cathartic. Bring yourself into the room and we’ll play with all the stuff you’re used to hiding:-) Through games, scene work and discussion you will find new doors into character work using more of yourself.
