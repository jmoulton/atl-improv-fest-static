  This workshop focuses on you becoming the improviser you always wanted to be!
  You have been working for years, but there is still something stopping you from
  realizing your potential? That is what happened in my life.
  I used to be an average improviser, but then I created a persona that had the
  skills and courage that I wanted to have.  I was still Greg - I was just a
  better version of myself when I improvised.  This persona was awesome at
  improv. He faced his fears. He was fun to play with. He made his partner
  look good and got laughs from the audience doing it.  The persona was a
  super hero version of myself (still me), just better. In this improv class
  we are going to try to get you to become your own Improv Super Hero.
