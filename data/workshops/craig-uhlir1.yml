  This workshop is about the value and built in support of the tag mechanism used in long form improv. We
  will play and discuss theories around tagging into scenes. Plot versus game versus function. La Ronde
  and Beer Shark Mice and Scene Chain ,all 3 being tag based long forms, will be discussed and
  taught. Play fast, play smart, play together.
