description: |
  You will gain confidence in knowing how to accept everything your scene partner gives you
  through making bold, committed character choices for yourself. Whether your scene partner
  tells you something that sounds negative or positive, you'll never feel weak or doubtful
  again. You'll fully understand how to use every bit of information, whether it's verbal or
  non-verbal, and make it work in organic, forward motion for successful scenes in full
  collaboration with your scene partners.
