  Mallory grew up in Vermont and has been living in Atlanta for almost 8 years. She has been dancing
  since she was 3 years old, holds a B.A. in Theatre and Music and a M.S. in Human Nutrition. In Atlanta,
  she has performed with Zoetic Dance Ensemble, Gathering Wild Dance, and as a Gotta Dance Atlanta Scholar,
  she has taught at Dance 101, Dance 411, Ballroom Dance Clubs of Atlanta and is the choreographer
  for Dadâ€™s Garage Theatre. With 15 years of teaching experience, Mallory recently found her niche
  working with new and seasoned movers helping to unlock their personal style. Her class is a combination
  of guided exercises that promote increased confidence with improvisational movement to incorporate into
  performance. Former students have said Mallory's class is freeing, therapeutic and intimacy building.
  Her goal is to facilitate students in stepping out of their comfort zone, tuning into their bodies
  and in turn creating more mindful movement.
