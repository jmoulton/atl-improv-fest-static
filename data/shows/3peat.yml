bio: |
  The show begins with a suggestion or personal question from the audience. A cast member will perform a monologue inspired by that suggestion. Then the rest of the cast then uses that monologue to do fast paced and hilarious long form improv piece.

  3Peat recently won best non-Harold team at the Del Awards at iO Chicago (in a vote by performers, students, and crew).
