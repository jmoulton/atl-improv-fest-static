bio: |
  Rufio is a long form duo comprised of Cassidy Russell (Chicago) and Vincent Migliore (Atlanta). Both Vincent and Cassidy have been performing together for five years, and performing/teaching/directing improv for even longer.

  Rufio has been described as two people with a lot of heart who do so much they seem like ten people. It is fast, fun, and endearing. Doing this show is their favorite thing in the world and it clearly shows.

  The Rufio show started as a regular show around Atlanta where they developed a strong following and ties to the improv community as long time instructors and coaches and main stage performers at The Village Theatre. Since they no longer live in the same city together, Vincent & Cassidy love to perform around the country at festivals and guests at other theatres.
