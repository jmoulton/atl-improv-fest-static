title: "Hill/Jones"
location: "Los Angeles, CA"
bio: |
  Since they first performed together (and won) the 2007 iO West Duo Competition, Hill Jones has performed regularly around LA at the UCB, Second City and their usual home, the iO West.  Playing with a high-energy and character-driven style, Dave Hill and Matt Jones have created shows about everything from a zombie apocalypse to a ninja quest to the recording of a blues legend’s last album.  Sometimes inhabiting multiple roles in the same scene, they employ genre and good old-fashioned storytelling in an attempt to create weird, wonderful worlds full of unique characters in every show they perform.  They even took this character-driven style to the world of feature film with their just released movie THE NIGHT IS YOUNG (now available on iTunes, Amazon, Vimeo and soon to be streaming!).
