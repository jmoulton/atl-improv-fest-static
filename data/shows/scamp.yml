location: "Chicago, IL"
bio: |
  Scamp is a Chicago based team made of five veteran improvisers who perform regularly at the Annoyance Theatre. Like to watch people who obviously love each other go a little wild on stage? That's us. Our focus is on finding joy onstage - and we sure do. We're very into playing with controlled chaos.

  Scamp hosts a weekly show at the Annoyance Theatre; otherwise they've performed around Chicago at Second City, iO, Bughouse Theater, the Crowd, and the Playground - as well as the Denver Improv Festival. They're weird and wild and ready to travel.
