bio: |
  BeerSharkMice is a long form improvisational show that originated in Los Angeles. A forty to forty-five minute long show based on a suggestion of a location. The location is the starting point for an array of scenes where the players tag in to spin the scene in a new direction or wildly out of control to sometimes end up full circle where it all began. 

  A well respected group of Chicago men that learned the art of Improvising from iO, The Second City and Annoyance Theater.

  The name BeerSharkMice came from the mind of Neil Flynn. It doesn’t mean anything, he jokingly said it, and we said that’s perfect!
