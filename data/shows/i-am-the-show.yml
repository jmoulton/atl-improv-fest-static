location: "Chicago, IL"
bio: |
  This show began in 2014, but had been being kicked around for several years prior.
  A two-man show, with one human, and one machine. One visual, one audio. One responding,
  the other giving. The audience picks one show or movie, and CG improvises dialogue,
  sound effects, and music. If it plays on Hulu, he improvises the commercials.
