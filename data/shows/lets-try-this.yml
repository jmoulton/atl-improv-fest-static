bio: |
  Since its founding in 1989, Let’s Try This! (LTT!) has entertained audiences as DramaTech Theatre’s student-run resident improv troupe. As our name suggests, we encourage our members to try everything from short-form games to long-form sets to what-in-the-world-was-that?, and we strive to make each other feel confident and supported while doing so. As a learning troupe, we endeavor to teach the basics and give our members the freedom and resources to experiment with form and style. Our number one commitment, though, is to give our members and our audiences a community based around entertainment and fun!
