bio: |
  The Estesstentials is Moonlight Stage Company's performance troupe under the direction of Jeris Donovan. These comics perform long form improvisation at a level beyond their years and many are professional actors seen on television and commercials.

  Their infectious energy has made them the talk of The Triangle earning them a spot at the 2016 NC Comedy Arts Festival, The 2016 Atlanta Improv Festival, The 2017 Downtown Raleigh Improv Festival, The 2018 NC Comedy Festival, and reoccurring gigs performing at Comedy Worx and opening for seasoned adult troupes such as Third Date and Transactors Improv. In every festival, they earned the honor of being the youngest accepted team in each festival's history. 

  The group will rang in the New Year for a 3rd time performing at First Night Raleigh and continues to perform as a house team at Moonlight Stage Company.
