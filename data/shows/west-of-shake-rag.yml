  The idea of West of Shake Rag was born at Cafe 212 in March of 2009 by Tupelo's own Caroline Upthegrove and Carlton Wall.

  Since it's Explosive Debut show at the Lyric Theatre in August of 2009, West of Shake Rag has gone on to perform at the world famous Chicago Improv Festival, has received standing ovations at the South Eastern Comedy Arts Festival, as well as founding and maintaining its own comedy festival in Tupelo, and represents to thousands that hard work and creative energy can go hand in hand in North Mississippi.

  West of Shake Rag has consistently performed family friendly comedy every month since summer 2010 and from 2014-15 held weekly shows featuring stand-up, sketch and more adult friendly material. They routinely visit and perform with other teams in the regional southeast, have come up with many original games and formats, and have appeared in films together. If you enjoy laughter, Shake Rag encourages you to come see them the second Saturday of the month at the Link Centre for the arts in Tupelo, MS. If laughing isnâ€™t your thing, please send an enemy!
