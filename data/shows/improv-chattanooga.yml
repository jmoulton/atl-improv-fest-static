bio: |
  Founded in 1995 in Dalton GA as "Runs With Scissors," this troupe has a
  long and storied history of performing around the Southeast Tennessee and North Georgia areas.
  In 2015, remaining RWS members Steve Disbrow and Kevin Bartolomucci decided to
  rebrand as "Improv Chattanooga," and focus on training the next generation of players.
  Since then, Improv Chattanooga has trained over 100 students, many of whom are now in the
  main troupe.

  In 2017, they signed the lease on their first full-time theater, and became Chattanooga's
  first and only Improv Theater, putting on 4 shows every week. (Two long form and 2 short form.)
  For the past two years, they've also put on a special "24 Hours of Improv" show as part of
  Chattanooga's "MainX24" downtown festival. They've recently expanded and moved to a newer,
  larger space, where they continue to put on 4 shows a week.
