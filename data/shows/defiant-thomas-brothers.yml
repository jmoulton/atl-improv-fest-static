bio: |
  The Defiant Thomas Brothers are an American comedy duo known for their fearless approach to material about race, stereotypes, and human nature. From their infamous “Jews” song, to a drug-deal remake of Abbott and Costello’s “Who’s on First,” they leave no PC stone unturned in pursuit of funny.

  Seth (a black guy from Oakland, California) and Paul (a white guy from Onalaska, Wisconsin) deftly ride the line of off-color comedy with sketches that are polished, commanding, and often provocative. An untouchable force in Chicago for over a decade, the unique camaraderie between the two writer/actors makes for relatable characters, smart comedy, and laughs you don’t expect. Their auto-biographical humor couples with an original recorded soundtrack, making every Thomas Brothers show an entirely Defiant experience.

  The Defiant Thomas Brothers are winners of best sketch group at HBO’s prestigious U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. Credits include Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Chicago Sketch Comedy Festival, Toronto Sketch Comedy Festival, Charleston Comedy Festival, Miami Improv Festival, The Second City Chicago, and more.
