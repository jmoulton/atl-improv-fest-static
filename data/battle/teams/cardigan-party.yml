name: Cardigan Party
bio: The Cardigan Party is a racially diverse team from Atlanta, Georgia. In August, we celebrated our second year together with a big birthday bit show. Weâ€™re best known for our meta-style performances. Throughout the show, we dive into high-energy stories and intense scene work... and then back out to commentate on those scenes (and how ridiculously awesome they were)!
cast: Courtney Overcash, Sara Bresee, Kimberly Bryant, Andrew Bracken, Kris Purushothaman, Hoover Wind
