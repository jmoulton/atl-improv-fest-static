layout: "show"
title: "Florida Studio Theatre"
time: "Saturday 7pm"
bio: "<p>Directed by Will Luera, FST Improv performs free-form style improvisation. The show is built on the concept
of \"follow the funny\" and proposes that every single moment, beat, line and movement in a show can be
deconstructed and used to lead you to the next scene. This is a high-energy improv experience that
redefines itself with every performance.</p>"
