bio: "<p>There’s an old saying that the best comedy material is created in a moment of spontaneous crisis. Truth be told, we just made that up, but it has all the promise of a soon-to-be old saying. That saying sums up the Village Theatre’s philosophy. We are an improvisational comedy company, and we take all of the material to fuel our stage performance from our audience.
 Since 2008, we’ve been entertaining Atlantans (and even some Dora-Villians) with long and short form improv comedy. What will happen? You need to be there to find out.</p>"
