          <p><span class="question">So... where do I party before and after the shows?</span><br/>
            Before the shows, head over to our sponsor <a href="http://nonisdeli.com/">Noni's</a> for dinner. Mention the festival and get 10% off all weekend long!<br/>
            Thursday night, <strong>Noni's</strong> is also our official after party destination!
          </p>

          <p><span class="question">Hey! What about the hashtag?</span><br/>
            Use <strong>#ATLIF2017</strong> all weekend long, because we like finding things on the Internet after they are posted.

          <p><span class="question">Why are there no more FAQs?</span><br/>
            Because we're still writing them.
