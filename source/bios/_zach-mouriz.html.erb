<h2>Zach Mouriz</h2>
<p>Zach hails from Tampa, FL where he's been improvising for half a decade with numerous teams around the bay area. He started performing in college where he quickly developed a knack for the art and became known for his fluid style and pinpoint body/object work. His sense of quick, loose, narrative-heavy long form led him to appear in mainstage shows at Unscripted Theatre in St. Petersburg, most recently Blank Slate & Westworld Unscripted. Zach has performed at numerous festivals including Miami, Sarasota, Orlando, Nashville, and Gainesville, and Palm Beach, and has helped produce the Tampa Bay Improv Festival since it began. Presently, he appears weekly at Unscripted Theatre with duo teams Faces & Kelvin & Kilo, as well as narrative team Cult Classic & mainstage show Westworld Unscripted.</p>
